# Privacy Policy

## **For Yanok Gab Chat App**

### How we handle your data for free users:

- All of your data include API keys, chat history, chat messages are stored locally on your browser (using Local Storage).
- The entire app is a static website, we don't have a backend server to collect data to the server side.
- When you send a message on chat.yanok.ai, the website sends a request to OpenAI API endpoints using the API key you provided.
- Requests are sent directly from your browser to OpenAI's server using secured transport protocol HTTPS. There is no middle server and no one else can see the requests, responses and their content.
- For Anthropic models, requests are proxied through Yanok Gab proxy server to Anthropic's server. This is because Anthropic doesn't support direct request from your browser. We don't log and store any data from the requests. The proxy server purely forwards your request to Anthropic's server and does nothing else. For maximum privacy, you can setup your own proxy server for Anthropic models by going to the Setting panel (click the gear icon) → Advanced Settings → Anthropic Chat Completions Endpoint.
- There is strictly no external JavaScript run on Yanok Gab.

### How we handle your data for paid users:

Privacy policy for paid users are the same as free users, with the following additional points:

- When you subscribe to a plan, we store your email address and plan details in our database. We use this information to send you information and verify your account to use Yanok Gab.
- When a new version of Yanok Gab is available, we will send you an email to notify you about new features and updates. You can unsubscribe from the email list at any time.

### Third-party services we use on Yanok AI:

- We use **Vercel.com** to host our website.
- We use **Vercel Analytics by Vercel.com** to collect anonymous analytics data (like how many visitors a day, etc.). This data is only collected from  and not from the self-hosted version.

### **For Cloud:**

- Cloud is an opt-in only service we provide to help you conveniently share your chat conversation with friends via a link that is publicly accessible from the internet. Other features include sync chat history between devices and backup chat history.
- Cloud is integrated to Yanok Gab and will only work when you explicitly use the Share/Sync/Backup feature, and pick Yanok Gab Could as the Share/Sync/Backup option. You will be asked to opt-in to Yanok Gab Cloud.
- Note that you can use other services to share and sync your chat. Yanok Gab Cloud is just one of the options and is not mandatory.
- When you **Share** your chats/plugins/AI agents using Yanok Gab Cloud, we will store your the data you shared on our server. And it will become publicly available on the internet with a secret link. These links are prevented from being indexed search engines.
- We only store the chats that you **shared**, we don't store any other data on Yanok Gab Cloud's server (no API Key, no License Key, no other chats).
- If you enable Yanok Gab Cloud for Sync and Backup, we will store all of your chats, prompts, messages, AI agents, bookmarks to the Yanok Gab Cloud server. All communication with Yanok Gab Cloud server are encrypted using HTTPS, all of your data is stored securely on our cloud database provided by AWS and is encrypted at rest.
