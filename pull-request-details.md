# GitHub Workflow Fixes Pull Request

## Description
This PR addresses the critical build issues in the CI/CD pipeline related to the lightningcss module and content formatting that were preventing successful builds in GitHub Actions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Import Syntax in index.js
- Fixed a typo in the import statement:
  ```js
  // From
  i mport Layout from '@/components/Layout';
  // To
  import Layout from '@/components/Layout';
  ```
  This syntax error would cause the build to fail before even attempting to process CSS.

### 2. Fixed Component Props Structure in dataUtils.js
- Updated the `getStaticProps` function to match the Layout component's expected props structure:
  ```js
  // From
  export async function getStaticProps() {
    return {
      props: {
        metaTags: (
          <>
            <title>${frontMatter.title || ''}</title>
            <meta name="description" content="${frontMatter.description || ''}" />
          </>
        ),
      },
    };
  }
  
  // To
  export async function getStaticProps() {
    return {
      props: {
        metaTitle: "${frontMatter.title || ''}",
        metaDescription: "${frontMatter.description || ''}"
      },
    };
  }
  ```
  This ensures that the Layout component receives the correct metadata props, preventing React errors during build.

### 3. Fixed Regex Patterns in fix-descriptions.js
- Corrected the escaped character sequences in regex patterns:
  ```js
  // From
  .replace(/description="([\\s\\S]*?)"/g, ...)
  .replace(/content="([\\s\\S]*?)"/g, ...)
  
  // To
  .replace(/description="([\s\S]*?)"/g, ...)
  .replace(/content="([\s\S]*?)"/g, ...)
  ```
  This ensures proper matching of multiline content in description and content attributes.

## How These Changes Address the Build Issues

1. By fixing the syntax and prop formatting errors, we eliminate the primary causes of build failures before the CSS processing stage is reached.

2. These changes complement the existing build process improvements documented in `github-workflow-fixes.md`, particularly:
   - The fallback CSS processing mechanisms in Next.js config
   - The graceful degradation paths for CSS plugins
   - The multiple binary resolution approaches for lightningcss

3. Proper formatting of JSX attributes and content helps avoid issues with the React compilation step that precedes CSS processing.

## Testing
The branch has been pushed and can be tested by running the GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow should now complete successfully without encountering the lightningcss module error.
