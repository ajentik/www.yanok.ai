        Channel partners are integral members of the Yanok family, transcending the traditional role of a mere channel. 
        As a core element of our culture we cater every function of our organization, frameworks, and infrastructure to help our partners leverage on our capabilities. 
        This approach ensures that partnerships are at the heart of our operations, enabling seamless collaboration and mutual growth.

        We focus on meaningful connectionsâ€”prioritizing support and assistance before business considerations come into play. 
        We foster these relationships through transparent and open communication, actively listening to our partners, adapting to their needs, and consistently delivering value.

        Principles:
        - Joint marketing efforts to leverage on the strongest pillars
        - Transparent commission rates and contribution goals to drive the growth
        - Consistent effort brings profits and creates exponential value over time
        - Partner success is our success to drive sustainable growth

        and provide the best products to our clients.
