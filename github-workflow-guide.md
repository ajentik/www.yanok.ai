# GitHub Actions Workflow for Yanok.ai Website

I've located your GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`. This file controls how your website is built and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Current Workflow Configuration

The current workflow is set up to:
1. Build a Jekyll site when changes are pushed to the `master` branch
2. Deploy the built site to GitHub Pages

### Key Points in Current Configuration:
- Runs on Ubuntu Linux
- Uses Ruby to build the Jekyll site
- Also installs Node.js 18 for any JavaScript dependencies
- Builds the site to the `_site` directory
- Deploys to GitHub Pages environment

## Modifying the Workflow

To update the workflow for your new website design, you have a few options:

### Option 1: Keep Jekyll (Simplest)

If your updated website still uses Jekyll (which appears to be the case), you likely don't need to modify the workflow file at all. The changes you made to `index.html` will be processed by Jekyll during the build step.

### Option 2: Update Jekyll Configuration

If you've made changes to how Jekyll processes your site:

```yaml
# Modify the build command as needed
- name: Build with Jekyll
  run: bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config_production.yml --baseurl "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}"
  env:
    JEKYLL_ENV: production
```

### Option 3: Migrate to Next.js (Advanced)

I see Next.js files in your repository. If you're fully migrating to Next.js, you'll need a new workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy Next.js site to Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build with Next.js
        run: npm run build
      - name: Static HTML export
        run: npm run export # Ensure this command exists in your package.json
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out # Next.js exports to the 'out' directory by default

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Recommended Action

Based on your project state:

1. If you've only updated the index page and are still using Jekyll:
   - No changes needed to the workflow file
   - Simply push your changes and the workflow will deploy them

2. If you're in the middle of migrating to Next.js:
   - Keep the current Jekyll workflow until migration is complete
   - Create a new branch for the Next.js migration work
   - Update the workflow when ready to switch completely

3. If you have specific deployment requirements:
   - Let me know what specific changes you need, and I can provide a more tailored workflow

To modify the workflow file, you can edit it directly:

```bash
# Open the file in VSCode
code .github/workflows/jekyll.yml

# After making changes, commit and push
git add .github/workflows/jekyll.yml
git commit -m "Update deployment workflow"
git push origin master
