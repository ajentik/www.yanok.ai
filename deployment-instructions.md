# Yanok.ai Website Deployment Instructions

## What's Been Done

1. ✅ **Updated index page** with modern design and improved UX
2. ✅ **Updated GitHub workflow** to deploy the Yanok.ai website
3. ✅ **Committed changes** to the local repository

## What's Left To Do

Your GitHub Actions workflow has been updated and committed locally. The next step is to push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin master
```

This will:
1. Upload your commits to the remote GitHub repository
2. Automatically trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Build and deploy the updated website to GitHub Pages

## Expected Deployment Workflow

Once you push your changes:

1. GitHub Actions will detect the change to the `master` branch
2. The workflow will:
   - Check out your code
   - Set up Ruby and Node.js
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your Jekyll site
   - Deploy it to GitHub Pages

3. You can monitor the progress in GitHub's "Actions" tab at:
   https://github.com/ajentik/www.yanok.ai/actions

4. After successful deployment, your site will be available at your GitHub Pages URL.

## Documentation Files Created

During this session, we've created several helpful guides:

1. **access-local-server.md** - Instructions for running the local development server
2. **git-commit-guide.md** - Guide for organizing and committing changes
3. **github-authentication-guide.md** - Guide for setting up GitHub authentication
4. **github-workflow-guide.md** - Guide for GitHub Actions workflow options
5. **setup-git-auth.sh** - Script for setting up GitHub authentication
6. **commit-changes.sh** - Script for organizing and committing changes

These files are for your reference and do not need to be deployed to the live website. You may choose to commit them to your repository if you find them useful for future reference.

## Next Steps for Next.js Migration

If you're planning to complete the migration to Next.js:

1. Create a new branch for the migration work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b nextjs-migration
   ```

2. Complete the migration development on this branch

3. When ready to deploy the Next.js version, update the workflow file using the Next.js template provided in the `github-workflow-guide.md` file.
