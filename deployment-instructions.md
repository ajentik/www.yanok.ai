# Yanok.ai Website Deployment Instructions

## What's Been Done

1. ✅ **Completed Next.js migration** from Jekyll
2. ✅ **Updated GitHub workflow** to deploy the Yanok.ai website
3. ✅ **Cleaned up Jekyll and Ruby-related files**
4. ✅ **Committed changes** to the local repository

## What's Left To Do

Your GitHub Actions workflow has been updated and committed locally. The next step is to push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin master
```

This will:
1. Upload your commits to the remote GitHub repository
2. Automatically trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Build and deploy the updated website to GitHub Pages

## Expected Deployment Workflow

Once you push your changes:

1. GitHub Actions will detect the change to the `master` branch
2. The workflow will:
   - Check out your code
   - Set up Node.js
   - Install dependencies with Yarn
   - Run tests
   - Build your Next.js site
   - Deploy it to GitHub Pages

3. You can monitor the progress in GitHub's "Actions" tab at:
   https://github.com/ajentik/www.yanok.ai/actions

4. After successful deployment, your site will be available at your GitHub Pages URL.

2. **git-commit-guide.md** - Guide for organizing and committing changes
3. **github-authentication-guide.md** - Guide for setting up GitHub authentication
4. **github-workflow-guide.md** - Guide for GitHub Actions workflow options

8. **commit-changes.sh** - Script for organizing and committing changes

These files are for your reference and do not need to be deployed to the live website. You may choose to commit them to your repository if you find them useful for future reference.
