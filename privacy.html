                This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Application to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User's device as they interact with this Application.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document â€“ unless there is a reason to differentiate.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">About Cookies and Trackers</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                While Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                This Application only uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called "first-party" Trackers).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Technical Cookies and Service Delivery</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                This Application uses so-called "technical" Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out activities that are strictly necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Managing Cookie Preferences</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw such consent by:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                <li>Setting preferences within the cookie notice</li>
                <li>Updating preferences via the consent-preferences privacy widget (if available)</li>
                <li>Deleting previously stored Trackers</li>
                <li>Clearing the browser's local memory</li>
