# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing lightningcss platform-specific binary**
   - Error: `Cannot find module '../lightningcss.linux-x64-gnu.node'`
   - Solution: Added a step to rebuild the lightningcss package specifically for the Linux platform in the GitHub Actions workflow

2. **Removed redundant export step**
   - The `next export` command is deprecated in Next.js 15+
   - The export functionality is now integrated into the build command when `output: 'export'` is configured in next.config.js

## How the Fix Works

1. The workflow now explicitly rebuilds the lightningcss package for Linux:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: |
       npm install
       # Force installation of lightningcss with the correct binary for the platform
       npm rebuild lightningcss --platform=linux --arch=x64
   ```

2. We're leveraging Next.js 15's built-in static export:
   - In `next.config.js`, we already have `output: 'export'` set for production builds
   - This automatically generates static files in the `out` directory
   - No separate export command is needed

## Why This Solves the Problem

The error occurred because TailwindCSS depends on lightningcss, which uses native binaries specific to each platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). When running in GitHub Actions' Ubuntu environment, it was trying to find a Linux binary but couldn't locate it.

By explicitly rebuilding the package for the Linux platform, we ensure the correct binary is available during the build process.

## Additional Notes

- If you encounter similar errors with other native dependencies, you may need to apply the same solution (rebuilding the package for the target platform)
- The GitHub Pages deployment will now work correctly as it uses the static files generated in the `out` directory
