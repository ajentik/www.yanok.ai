  :name: Poll Contact
  :description: Triggers when a updated contact is found in the poll list. This is
    an alternative for the "Updated Contact" trigger. It works by asking Zabun for
    updated contacts, rather than getting an instant notification when a contact is
    updated. Therefore, it is more inclusive, as it can also get updated contact from
    external sources that aren't Zabun. But it is not as fast a regular trigger, since
    that polling only occurs every 5 to 15 minutes. This poll trigger can also replace
    the "New Contact" trigger.
