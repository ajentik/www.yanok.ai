    - Each subscription can be used on 5 devices which is typically enough for 1 user. If you need to use it on for more devices, you can add more devices to your existing subscription. "Device" is counted based on the number of places where the license key is entered and the chat history is saved for continuous use. For example, if you use Yanok Gab on Chrome browser on your laptop and also on your phone, that will be 2 devices. Note that the license key is saved per browser, so if you use Yanok Gab on Chrome and also on Firefox, you will need to enter the license key 2 times, have 2 separate chat history storage, and that counts as 2 devices. If you need to use the platform on a new device but have reached the limit, you can unlink the previous device first using the Account Manager. This device limit is put in place to avoid license key abuse and pirate.
