# Next.js GitHub Pages Compatibility Analysis

I've analyzed our Next.js configuration to ensure it's fully compatible with GitHub Pages deployment.

## Current Configuration Review

### ✅ Static Export Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: 'export',  // Generates static HTML/CSS/JS files
  // ...
}
```
**Status**: ✓ Compatible - We're using `output: 'export'` which generates static files instead of requiring a Node.js server.

### ✅ Base Path Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.js
const basePath = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH || '';
module.exports = {
  basePath,
  assetPrefix: basePath,
  // ...
}
```
**Status**: ✓ Compatible - We're correctly using GitHub Pages environment variable to set the base path.

### ✅ Image Optimization
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    unoptimized: true, // Required for static export
    domains: ['www.yanok.ai'],
  },
  // ...
}
```
**Status**: ✓ Compatible - We've set `unoptimized: true` which allows Next.js Image component to work in static exports.

### ✅ Trailing Slashes
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: true,
  // ...
}
```
**Status**: ✓ Compatible - Trailing slashes improve compatibility with static hosting platforms.

### ✅ Build Memory Allocation
```yaml
# .github/workflows/nextjs.yml
- name: Build with Next.js (with increased memory)
  run: |
    export NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=6144"
    npm run build
```
**Status**: ✓ Compatible - We've allocated sufficient memory for the build process.

## Potential Issues to Watch For

### Server Components
If you're using React Server Components, ensure they can be statically generated. Server Components that fetch data during the request cycle may not work as expected with static export.

### API Routes
API routes (`pages/api/*` or `app/api/*`) won't function on GitHub Pages since there's no Node.js server. Consider alternatives:
- Use client-side API calls to external services
- Pre-generate data at build time
- Use serverless functions from services like Vercel Edge Functions or AWS Lambda

### Environment Variables
- Build-time environment variables work fine
- Runtime environment variables that change after deployment won't work with static export
- Make sure any sensitive variables aren't exposed in client-side code

## GitHub Pages Settings

For GitHub Pages to work correctly with Next.js:

1. Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
2. It should be set to deploy from the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Custom domain settings (if any) should be configured in repository settings

## Recommendation

Our Next.js configuration is fully compatible with GitHub Pages. When you push this configuration to GitHub, the Next.js workflow should:

1. Check out your code
2. Build the static export
3. Deploy it to GitHub Pages

If you encounter any issues, the most common problems would be:
- Memory limitations during build
- Dynamic routes that aren't properly generated as static paths
- Server-side features being used that are incompatible with static hosting
